**[---TAR---]** 

* bundling files together into a single archive file.
* Creating and manipulating tar archives
* For backups
* This allows you to transfer a single archive file instead of transferring individual files

*  fs / fs-extra
    * The fs module in Node.js stands for "File System." It is a built-in module that provides functions for interacting with the file system on your computer. This module allows you to perform various operations such as reading from and writing to files, creating directories, renaming files, deleting files, and more.

    * fs-extra is for additional functionalities and utilities


* fs.emptyDirSync('./build/_next/')
    * This line ensures that the destination directory (./build/_next/) is empty before copying files into it.
    * This line copies all files and directories from the ./_next directory to the ./build/_next/ directory synchronously.


* When the gzip if false, means that the tar file is not compressed using gzip.
    * While creating means no need to compress it using gzip
    * While extracting means no need to decompress it using gzip



Steps: 
* Project is created
* When you're ready to deploy your application, you typically run a build process to generate optimized production-ready assets.
* Then build is generated in the .next folder (generated by a Next.js build process)
* Then you may copy the files in the .next folder and copy them somwhere else. (lets say, ''./build/_next/)
* The copied files in the ./build/_next/ directory, along with other project files, will be packaged into the tar archive.
* The tar.create() function is used to create a tar archive from the files in the ./build directory.
* Then you can set the prefix for setting the directory structure needed at the CDN
* Once the tar archive is created, it needs to be uploaded to the CDN. This step is typically done using a separate process or CL tool or automated deployment process.
* After the tar archive is uploaded to the CDN, the CDN distributes the files to its edge servers located around the world.
* When users access your application, the CDN serves the files from its edge servers, improving performance and reducing latency.


CDN
* A CDN consists of a network of geographically distributed servers called edge servers or edge nodes.
* These are used to redice the RTT to the ORIGIN SERVER (main servers)
* When a user requests content, the CDN checks if it has a cached copy of the requested content on one of its edge servers.
* If the content is available in the cache and is still fresh (i.e., not expired), the CDN serves the content directly from the edge server to the user without needing to fetch it from the origin server.
* It reduces RTT (Round trip time)
* The CDN infrastructure includes not only edge servers but also networking equipment, caching mechanisms, load balancers, and other components necessary for content delivery.


Edge Servers
* These servers are part of a content delivery network (CDN) infrastructure, Edge servers are the backbone of a CDN
* The purpose of this geographical distribution is to bring content closer to end-users regardless of their location. By having servers located closer to users, content delivery can be faster and more efficient.
* Edge servers are basically for caching
* These edge servers are strategically located in various regions and cities around the world, often in or near internet exchange points (IXPs) and data centers.
* These are optimized with load balancing and failover mechanisms to distribute traffic efficiently and ensure high availability.
